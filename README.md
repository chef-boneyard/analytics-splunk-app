## Setup:

1. [Download](https://downloads.chef.io/analytics/) and [install](https://docs.chef.io/install_analytics.html) Chef Analytics.
2. Configure a notification for your Splunk Server:
  * Go to `Notifications` tab in your Analytics UI.
  * Click `+` and select `Splunk`.
  * Give your configuration a name for e.g. `my-splunk-notifier`
  * Configure `hostname`, `port`, `username` & `password` for your Splunk Server.
  * Port should be `8089`.
3. Create the necessary rules to send data to your Splunk Server. You will need 3 rules:
  ```
  rules 'Splunk'
    rule on action
    when
      true
    then
      notify('my-splunk-notifier')
    end
  
    rule on run_converge
    when
      true
    then
      notify('my-splunk-notifier')
    end
  
    rule on run_resource
    when
      true
    then
      notify('my-splunk-notifier')
    end
  end
  ```

  **NOTE: These rules must be inserted verbatim. Any variance from the rules above will result in a non-functioning integration.

1. Install Chef Analytics Splunk App in your Splunk Server [How do I install a Splunk Packaged App?](http://answers.splunk.com/answers/51894/how-to-install-a-splunk-app.html)

**NOTE: You must be using Splunk Enterprise to be able to install the Chef Analytics for Splunk App. Splunk Light does not support the installation of Packaged Apps.**
